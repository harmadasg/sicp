# Berkeley's CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I've finally decieded to work through the recommended courses on [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com).
I went with the default choices for programming:
* The book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* The video lectures held by Brian Harvey.

Luckily all of the required materials are available online to complete the course, see this [amazing collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theurere/berkeley_cs61a_spring-2011_archive/master/README.md) for the full list.
